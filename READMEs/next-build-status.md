## Goal

This document is used to keep track of the current state of the Next Build migration efforts. All Next Build progress and in-flight work will be located in this file.

## Layouts

Completed layouts are currently being tracked in [templates.md] (https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/next-build/blob/main/READMEs/templates.md).
The following templates are in development (7/9/24)

## Applications

Work to handle the migration of applications is still in development. A spike has been completed to investigate how application injection was handled inside of content-build. The application approach is set to mimic what was previously done for content-build. Once this approach has been approved, work will begin on implementation. The tickets for the spike and application work can be found in GitHub
