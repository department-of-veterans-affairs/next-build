# Template directory structure.

Template components are stored at `src/templates`. Templates are divided into the following subdirectories:

- `src/templates/common`: small reusable UI elements, i.e. pagers, links, images, or components that are used site-wide (header, footer)
- `src/templates/components`: small units with specific content functions. In Drupal these would correspond to Paragraphs and to smaller representations of content, i.e. a listing of News Stories with teaser text and a thumbnail for each story.
- `src/templates/layouts`: full page displays or page wrappers.
