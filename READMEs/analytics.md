# Analytics in next-build:

1. Most client-side analytics are handled automatically when using components from the VA Design System.
2. Additional custom events can be managed using Google Tag Manager via [react-gtm-module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-gtm-module). See `src/pages/_app.tsx` and `src/lib/analytics` for implementation details.

Existing content-build analytics tags for reference:

- [vagovdev](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/content-build/blob/main/src/site/assets/js/google-analytics/vagovdev.js)
- [vagovstaging](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/content-build/blob/main/src/site/assets/js/google-analytics/vagovstaging.js)
- [vagovprod](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/content-build/blob/main/src/site/assets/js/google-analytics/vagovprod.js)

2. VA.gov participates in the US governmentâ€™s analytics program. See the data at analytics.usa.gov.

3. Datadog integration coming soon. Some metrics are sent during GHA workflows. Real user monitoring (RUM) and other analytics of that nature still need to be integrated in next-build proper. See: https://www.datadoghq.com/product/real-user-monitoring/
