# Template Migration: Pre-Migration

## What is the Pre-Migration phase?

A template is in the Pre-Migration phase when it doesn’t exist in `next-build`.

A template is ready and can be picked up from the Pre-migration column and moved into the Development column if the “Needs refining” label has been removed from the Migration ticket.

## Transitioning to Active Migration

**Trigger**: The template gets prioritized and assigned to a team.

**Next step:** [Active Migration](./active-migration/readme.md)
