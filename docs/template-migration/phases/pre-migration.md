# Template Migration: Pre-Migration

## What is the Pre-Migration phase?

A template is in the Pre-Migration phase when it either doesnâ€™t exist in `next-build` or is stale.

_Nothing fancy here._

## Transitioning to Active Migration

**Trigger**: The template gets prioritized and assigned to a team.

**Next step:** [Active Migration](./active-migration.md)
