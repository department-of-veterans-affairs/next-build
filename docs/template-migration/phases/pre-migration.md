# Template Migration: Pre-migration

## What is the Pre-migration phase?

A template is in the Pre-migration phase when it either doesnâ€™t exist in next-build or is stale.

_Nothing fancy here._

## Transitioning to Active Migration

**Trigger**: The template gets prioritized and assigned to a team.

**Next step:** [Active Migration](./active-migration.md)
