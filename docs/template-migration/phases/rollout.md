# Template Migration: Rollout

## What is the Rollout phase?

A template is in the Rollout phase when QA is complete and the template is ready to be utilized to generate content in production.

## What do we do here?

- Go / no go meeting for approval of cutover from content-build to next-build
  - Required attendees include
    - Erika Washburn
    - Chris Valarida
    - Laura Flannery
    - Michelle Middaugh (optional)
  - Eventually, this meeting will get replaced with async comms
- Launch to production
  - Task owned by CMS team, regardless of which team did the migration
  - Exceptions to this ownership would need to be requested and discussed during the migration process

## How do we do it?
