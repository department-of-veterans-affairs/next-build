<p><strong>@Shelley's team&nbsp;</strong>If functionality is available, this could be an alert box or similar component</p>

<p>If you are a Veteran who is homeless or at risk of becoming homeless due to financial hardship, unemployment, addiction, depression, or transition from jail, VA Pittsburgh can help you with:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Immediate food and shelter needs</li>
	<li>Transitional and permanent housing</li>
	<li>Job training and life skills development</li>
	<li>Educational opportunities</li>
	<li>Support with justice system navigation</li>
	<li>Re-entry from jail into the community</li>
	<li>Financial support to prevent homelessness</li>
	<li>Treatment for addiction and depression</li>
	<li>Health and dental care</li>
	<li>Case management</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>@Shelley's team</strong> may want to consider whether different care coordinators should be listed on different accordions. For example, should Mary Frances be listed here because she handles all general incoming requests for homeless services, while Linda should be listed on the "permanent housing" accordion because she handles HUD-VASH cases?</p>

<p>For local help getting started with any of these services, contact a VA Pittsburgh homeless services care coordinator. We can help determine what programs are right for you.</p>

<h4>Contact</h4>

<hr>
<p><strong>@Shelley team:&nbsp;</strong>For contacts like this, we need to answer these questions: Does Joseph only handle transitional housing cases? (If so, only list him with the transitional housing info.) Does John act as a care coordinator for ALL homeless services? (If so, consider listing him here but leaving off the title "Transitional housing liaison", which is distracting to the user and makes them wonder if he's the right person to be contacting.)</p>

<p><strong>@Shelley team:</strong> This name and number is on a PDF brochure for Pittsburgh VA homeless services, but not on the web page. Not sure whether to include.</p>

<p><strong>@Shelley team:</strong> to fill in, if this is a viable way to get help with homeless services</p>

<p><strong>@Shelley team:&nbsp;</strong>Both these numbers are listed in the directory. Only the first is listed on the website page. Which is better? Why?</p>

<p><strong>@Shelley team:&nbsp;</strong>Giving the name and location of this program here might be distracting, as the CTA is really just to call the number.</p>
