<p>Dr. Decker, director of Infection Prevention, sees herself as a problem solver.</p>

<p>\\"The problems that cause infections are incredibly varied and sometimes challenging,\\" said Decker. \\"My job involves getting the right people together to help solve these problems.\\"</p>

<p>Recent examples include ensuring hand sanitizers are plentiful and optimally located to support hand hygiene; safe disposal of needles and syringes; and developing the safest way to shut down and perform maintenance on an air handler in a patient-care area that is always open.</p>

<p>Dr. Rahman, a cardiologist, has been director of the Cardiac Cath Lab for the past six years. He credits his dedicated and skilled team for the lab's success, but he says one other factor plays a big role in that success.</p>


    <p>
    \\"The icing on top is the staff's eagerness to help our Veterans,\\"
    said
    Rahman.
    \\"All hospital environments can be intense and demanding and come with general and specific challenges. But having co-workers whom one can count on makes my job at VA an invaluable opportunity.\\"

<p>Rahman said he's been fascinated since childhood with how the human body works.</p>

    said.
    \\"Cardiology is not just a career choice, but a calling, and I think it found me.\\"

<p>Both doctors said the best part of working at VA is listening to Veterans' stories.</p>

    \\"I love sitting down at the bedside and hearing about someone's family, pets, adventures,\\"
    said
    Decker.
    \\"I've met some truly great people working at VA.\\"

<p>Rahman said Veterans' stories make every day at work interesting.</p>

    \\"As I interact with my patients, I get to hear a lot of fascinating stories of their experiences all over the world,\\"
    said
    Rahman.
    \\"It's never a dull day at work.\\"
