  "bodyContent": "<p>VA Pittsburgh's Outstanding Physicians of the Year for 2019, Drs. Brooke Decker and Aref M. Rahman, stand out for expertly filling critical medical facility roles while fostering a collaborative spirit among staff in caring for Veterans.</p>

<p>Dr. Decker, director of Infection Prevention, sees herself as a problem solver.</p>

<p>"The problems that cause infections are incredibly varied and sometimes challenging," said Decker. "My job involves getting the right people together to help solve these problems."</p>

<p>Recent examples include ensuring hand sanitizers are plentiful and optimally located to support hand hygiene; safe disposal of needles and syringes; and developing the safest way to shut down and perform maintenance on an air handler in a patient-care area that is always open.</p>

<p>Dr. Rahman, a cardiologist, has been director of the Cardiac Cath Lab for the past six years. He credits his dedicated and skilled team for the lab's success, but he says one other factor plays a big role in that success.</p>


    <p>
    "The icing on top is the staff's eagerness to help our Veterans,"
    said
    Rahman.
    "All hospital environments can be intense and demanding and come with general and specific challenges. But having co-workers whom one can count on makes my job at VA an invaluable opportunity."
    </p>
        n
    

    <p>Decker
    said
    she
    likens
    her
    investigative
    work
    to
    that
    of
    the
    fictional
    private
    detective
    Sherlock
    Holmes
    or
    Dr.
    Gregory
    House,
    a
    fictional
    doctor
    who
    solved
    medical
    mysteries
    on
    television
    's "House" series.</p>


    <p>
    "For every issue, there may be layers and layers of additional clues to unravel,"
    said
    Decker.
    "The 'aha moment' when it all comes together is very gratifying."
    </p>
        n
    
<p>Even so, Decker says preventing illness in the first place is even more gratifying.</p>


    <p>
    "Caring for a single patient and solving that one patient's illness is our honor and privilege as health care providers,"
    said
    Decker.
    "Preventing 10 patients from getting sick is even better, and that's what we strive to do in Infection Prevention."
    </p>
        n
    
<p>Rahman said he's been fascinated since childhood with how the human body works.</p>


    <p>
    "I would read all kinds of articles about new discoveries in medicine and I found myself being drawn more and more toward what is literally the 'heart' of our bodies,"
    he
    said.
    "Cardiology is not just a career choice, but a calling, and I think it found me."
    </p>
        n
    
<p>Both doctors said the best part of working at VA is listening to Veterans' stories.</p>


    <p>
    "I love sitting down at the bedside and hearing about someone's family, pets, adventures,"
    said
    Decker.
    "I've met some truly great people working at VA."
    </p>
        n
    
<p>Rahman said Veterans' stories make every day at work interesting.</p>


    <p>
    "As I interact with my patients, I get to hear a lot of fascinating stories of their experiences all over the world,"
    said
    Rahman.
    "It's never a dull day at work."
    </p>
        n
    
<p>Decker and Rahman were formally recognized as Outstanding Physicians of the Year on April 26 during the medical staff's quarterly meeting at University Drive.</p>",
