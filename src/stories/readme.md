# Storybook

**All components should have a `*.stories.tsx` file in their directory next to their tests.**

This directory is for `*.mdx` files that provide markdown for storybook pages separately from components.
See `introduction.mdx` for details.

It also houses decorators that can provide additional context to a story before it renders. We use one for rendering VADS web components and other widgets from vets-website in Storybook.
