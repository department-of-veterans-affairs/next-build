# Drupal types

The types in this directory correspond to Drupal's data structures. They are used to verify that the structures we are receiving from Drupal are valid, and to verify that mapping functions are taking input of an expected structure.

These types should not be used as types for components. They are strictly for data request and mapping purposes.
