      "html": "<h2>United States Government Life Insurance (USGLI)</h2>

<p><strong>Veterans insured: </strong>WWI<br>
<strong>Years issued: </strong>1919 to 1951<br>
<strong>Policies still in force:</strong> Fewer than 8,000<br>
<strong>Average age of policyholders:</strong> 88 years old</p>

<p>Policies were issued in a variety of permanent plans and as renewable term insurance. The maximum face amount of a USGLI policy is $10,000. All USGLI policies were declared paid up as of January 1, 1983, meaning that no further premium payments were due. Annual dividends continue to be paid on these policies.</p>

<h3>Endowment at age 96</h3>

<p>Veterans with a 5-Year Level Premium plan under the USGLI program had the opportunity to exchange it for a special endowment plan payable at age 96.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a term life insurance plan that provides coverage until the year of the Veteran's 96th birthday. If the Veteran dies before age 96, the insurance payout goes to the plan beneficiary. If the Veteran reaches the policy anniversary closest to their 96th birthday, they receive the face value of the policy, minus any amount borrowed against it.</p>

<p>For example, if the Veteran's policy anniversary is September 1 and their birthday is October 1, they would receive the policy payout on September 1.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Policy proceeds are paid either in a lump sum or on an installment basis.</p>

<p>This plan doesn't provide permanent and total disability benefits.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It doesn't provide a waiver of premium once in force, though a waiver of premium provision could have been purchased at the time this plan was exchanged for the 5-Year Level Premium plan.</p>

<h2>National Service Life Insurance (NSLI)</h2>

<p><strong>Veterans insured:</strong> WWII<br>
<strong>Years issued:</strong> 1940 to 1951<br>
<strong>Policies still in force:</strong> 950,000<br>
<strong>Average age of policyholders:</strong> 81 years old</p>

<p>Annual dividends are paid on these policies. The maximum face amount of a policy is $10,000. However, this limit doesn't include paid-up additional insurance, which can be purchased with the annual dividends. Certain disability benefits are available under these policies for policyholders who become totally disabled before their 65th birthday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Premium rates are capped at age 70. This means that a term policyholder's premium will never increase over the age 70 premium rate.</p>

<p>Effective September 11, 2000, "capped" NSLI term policies receive a termination dividend if a policy lapses, or if the policyholder voluntarily cancels their policy. The termination dividend will be used to purchase paid-up additional whole life insurance.</p>

<h2>Veterans' Special Life Insurance (VSLI)</h2>

<p><strong>Veterans insured:</strong> Korean War<br>
<strong>Years issued:</strong> 1951 to 1956<br>
<strong>Policies still in force: </strong>181,000<br>
<strong>Average age of policyholders:</strong> 75 years old</p>

<p>Annual dividends are paid on these policies. The maximum face amount of a policy is $10,000. However, this limit does not include paid-up additional insurance, which can be purchased with the annual dividends. Certain disability benefits are available under these policies for policyholders who become totally disabled before their 65th birthday.</p>

<p>Premium rates are capped at age 70. This means that a term policyholder's premium will never increase over the age 70 premium rate. This means that the annual premium for these policies will not exceed $69.73 per $1,000 of coverage.</p>

<p>Effective September 11, 2000, "capped" VSLI term policies receive a termination dividend if a policy lapses, or if the policyholder voluntarily cancels their policy. The termination dividend will be used to purchase paid-up additional whole life insurance.</p>

<h2>Veterans' Reopened Insurance</h2>

<p><strong>Veterans insured:</strong> Disabled WWII and Korean War<br>
<strong>Years issued:</strong> 1965 to 1966<br>
<strong>Policies still in force:</strong> More than 41,000<br>
<strong>Average age of policyholders:</strong> <strong>??</strong> years old</p>

<p>Annual dividends are paid on these policies. The maximum face amount of a policy is $10,000. However, this limit doesn't include paid-up additional insurance, which can be purchased with the dividends that are paid annually on these policies. Certain disability benefits are available under these policies for policyholders who become totally disabled before their 65th birthday.</p>
