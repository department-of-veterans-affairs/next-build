# Template directory structure.

Template components are stored at `src/templates`. Templates are divided into the following subdirectories:

* `src/templates/common`: small reusable UI elements, i.e. pagers, links, images
* `src/templates/components`: small units with specific content functions. In Drupal these would correspond to Paragraphs and to smaller representations of content, i.e. a listing of News Stories with teaser text and a thumbnail for each story.
* `src/templates/globals/`: components that are used site-wide, i.e. header, footer, menus.
* `src/templates/layouts`: full page displays.
