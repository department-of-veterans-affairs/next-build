# next-build

Front-end templating, build, and deploy for VA.gov CMS content. General documentation will be here: https://vfs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PCMS/pages/2166063172/next-build

## Local setup
Prerequisites

* [VA SOCKS access](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/getting-started/Internal-tools-access-via-SOCKS-proxy.1821081710.html)
* [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for node version management
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) for package management

You should set these up before attempting to install the repo.

### Basic local installation
1. Clone the repo if you haven't.
    `git@github.com:department-of-veterans-affairs/next-build.git`

1. Run `yarn install`.

1. Copy .env.example to .env.local. This is a reasonable set of environment defaults for local development.

1. Make sure your SOCKS access is running.

1. Run `yarn dev`.

You will now have a Next.js development server running at http://localhost:3000, which will refresh with changes to your local environment.
